## React JS Project 1 - Cat Rolodex

My first React project, "Cat Rolodex," is a learning endeavor where users' information and cat vector images are dynamically fetched and searchable in real-time. This interactive application offers a seamless experience, allowing users to explore and filter cat images effortlessly.
